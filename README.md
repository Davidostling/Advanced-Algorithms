# Advanced-Algorithms
 
Completed a series of individual- and group assignments, as well as a project, for an advanced algorithms course that I took at KTH. 

The course focused on advanced algorithmic concepts such as randomized algorithms, approximation algorithms, and fixed-parameter algorithms. Additionally, this course also placed a strong emphasis on data structures and complexity, significantly improving my skills in these fields. My tasks included developing efficient algorithms based on these concepts, independently researching and implementing existing advanced algorithms, and improving them with heuristics.
